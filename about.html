                Lana Del Rey (born June 21, 1985, as Elizabeth Woolridge Grant) makes vulnerable, emotional pop music that often incorporates nostalgia for America's past. Del Rey first performed under her real name of Lizzy Grant but found fame as Lana Del Rey in 2011 with a homemade music video for the song "Video Games." After "Video Games" became a viral hit, Del Rey was criticized for a lack of authenticity; she's also been called out for songs that sometimes feature female submissiveness and self-destruction. She has an extensive fanbase and has sold millions of albums, with 2014's Ultraviolence and 2017's Lust for Life both landing at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.
